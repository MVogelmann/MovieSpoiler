      <h2>Plot</h2>
      <p>
        After a birthday party three girls, around 14 years old, get kidnapped
        by a man who has 23 different personalities. At the beginning, the kidnapper
        is "Dennis", but he changes his personalities to e.g. "Kevin", who is
        in therapy with Dr. Fletcher, or "Hedwig", a nine year old boy.
        The situation lets the three girls grow more and more together.
        Dr. Fletcher gets alarmed by the number of split personalities of the man
        and decides to visit his place at the middle of the night.
        <span class="spoiler-protect">
          She secretly finds the three kidnapped girls, but the split man recognizes
          it and he changes into the 24th personality, called the beast.
          He kills Dr. Fletcher and two of the girls, but one girl can escape from him.
